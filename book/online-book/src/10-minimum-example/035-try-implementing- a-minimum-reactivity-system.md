# Try Implementing a Small Reactivity System

## Reactivity Mechanism Using Proxy

::: info Differences in Design Compared to the Current `vuejs/core`
As of December 2024, Vue.js's Reactivity system employs a doubly linked list-based Observer Pattern.\
This implementation, introduced in [Refactor reactivity system to use version counting and doubly-linked list tracking](https://github.com/vuejs/core/pull/10397), has contributed significantly to performance improvements.  

However, for those implementing a reactivity system for the first time, this can be somewhat challenging to grasp. In this chapter, we will create a simplified implementation of the traditional (pre-optimization) system.\
For a more detailed explanation of a system closer to the current implementation, please refer to [Reactivity Optimization](/30-basic-reactivity-system/005-reactivity-optimization).  

Another significant improvement, [feat(reactivity): more efficient reactivity system](https://github.com/vuejs/core/pull/5912), will be covered in a separate chapter.  
:::

To clarify the purpose again, the purpose this time is to "execute `updateComponent` when the state is changed". Let me explain the implementation process using Proxy.

First, Vue.js's Reactivity System involves `target`, `Proxy`, `ReactiveEffect`, `Dep`, `track`, `trigger`, `targetMap`, and `activeEffect` (currently `activeSub`).

First, let's talk about the structure of targetMap.
targetMap is a mapping of keys and deps for a certain target.
Target refers to the object you want to make reactive, and dep refers to the effect (function) you want to execute. You can think of it that way.
In code, it looks like this:

```ts
type Target = any // any target
type TargetKey = any // any key that the target has

const targetMap = new WeakMap<Target, KeyToDepMap>() // defined as a global variable in this module

type KeyToDepMap = Map<TargetKey, Dep> // a map of target's key and effect

type Dep = Set<ReactiveEffect> // dep has multiple ReactiveEffects

class ReactiveEffect {
  constructor(
    // here, you give the function you want to actually apply as an effect (in this case, updateComponent)
    public fn: () => T,
  ) {}
}
```

This basic structure is responsible for the rest, and then we think about how to create (register) targetMap and how to execute the effect.

That's where the concepts of `track` and `trigger` come in.
As the names suggest, `track` is a function that registers in `targetMap`, and `trigger` is a function that retrieves the effect from `targetMap` and executes it.

```ts
export function track(target: object, key: unknown) {
  // ..
}

export function trigger(target: object, key?: unknown) {
  // ..
}
```

And these `track` and `trigger` are implemented in the get and set handlers of Proxy.

```ts
const state = new Proxy(
  { count: 1 },
  {
    get(target, key, receiver) {
      track(target, key)
      return target[key]
    },
    set(target, key, value, receiver) {
      target[key] = value
      trigger(target, key)
      return true
    },
  },
)
```

The API for generating this Proxy is the reactive function.

```ts
function reactive<T>(target: T) {
  return new Proxy(target, {
    get(target, key, receiver) {
      track(target, key)
      return target[key]
    },
    set(target, key, value, receiver) {
      target[key] = value
      trigger(target, key)
      return true
    },
  })
}
```

![reactive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chibivue-land/chibivue/main/book/images/reactive.drawio.png)

Here, you may notice one missing element. That is, "which function to register in track?".
The answer is the concept of `activeEffect`.
This is also defined as a global variable in this module, just like targetMap, and is set in the `run` method of ReactiveEffect.

```ts
let activeEffect: ReactiveEffect | undefined

class ReactiveEffect {
  constructor(
    // here, you give the function you want to actually apply as an effect (in this case, updateComponent)
    public fn: () => T,
  ) {}

  run() {
    activeEffect = this
    return this.fn()
  }
}
```

To understand how it works, imagine a component like this.

```ts
{
  setup() {
    const state = reactive({ count: 0 });
    const increment = () => state.count++;

    return function render() {
      return h("div", { id: "my-app" }, [
        h("p", {}, [`count: ${state.count}`]),
        h(
          "button",
          {
            onClick: increment,
          },
          ["increment"]
        ),
      ]);
    };
  },
}
```

Internally, this is how reactivity is formed.

```ts
// Implementation inside chibivue
const app: App = {
  mount(rootContainer: HostElement) {
    const componentRender = rootComponent.setup!()

    const updateComponent = () => {
      const vnode = componentRender()
      render(vnode, rootContainer)
    }

    const effect = new ReactiveEffect(updateComponent)
    effect.run()
  },
}
```

To explain step by step, first, the `setup` function is executed.\
A reactive proxy is generated at this point. In other words, any operation performed on the proxy created here will behave as configured in the proxy.

```ts
const state = reactive({ count: 0 }) // Generating a proxy
```

Next, we pass `updateComponent` to create a `ReactiveEffect` (Observer side).

```ts
const effect = new ReactiveEffect(updateComponent)
```

The `componentRender` used in `updateComponent` is a function that is the `return value` of `setup`, and this function references the object created by the proxy.

```ts
function render() {
  return h('div', { id: 'my-app' }, [
    h('p', {}, [`count: ${state.count}`]), // Referencing the object created by the proxy
    h(
      'button',
      {
        onClick: increment,
      },
      ['increment'],
    ),
  ])
}
```

When this function is actually executed, the `getter` function of `state.count` is executed, and `track` is triggered. 
In this situation, let's execute the effect.

```ts
effect.run()
```

Then, `updateComponent` (a ReactiveEffect with `updateComponent`) is set to `activeEffect`. 
When `track` is triggered in this state, a map of `state.count` and `updateComponent` (a ReactiveEffect with `updateComponent`) is registered in `targetMap`. 
This is how reactivity is formed.

Now, let's consider what happens when `increment` is executed. 
Since `increment` is rewriting `state.count`, the `setter` is executed, and `trigger` is triggered. 
`trigger` finds and executes the `effect` (in this case, updateComponent) from `targetMap` based on `state` and `count`. 
This is how the screen update is triggered!

This allows us to achieve reactivity.

It's a bit complicated, so let's summarize it in a diagram.

![reactivity_create](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chibivue-land/chibivue/main/book/images/reactivity_create.drawio.png)

## Based on these, let's implement it.

The most difficult part is understanding everything up to this point, so once you understand it, all you have to do is write the source code.
However, even if you understand only the above, there may be some people who cannot understand it without knowing what is actually happening.
For those people, let's try implementing it here first. Then, while reading the actual code, please refer back to the previous section!

First, let's create the necessary files. We will create them in `packages/reactivity`.
Here, we will try to be conscious of the configuration of the original Vue as much as possible.

```sh
pwd # ~
mkdir packages/reactivity

touch packages/reactivity/index.ts

touch packages/reactivity/dep.ts
touch packages/reactivity/effect.ts
touch packages/reactivity/reactive.ts
touch packages/reactivity/baseHandler.ts
```

As usual, `index.ts` just exports, so I won't explain it in detail. Export what you want to use from the reactivity external package here.

Next is `dep.ts`.

```ts
import { type ReactiveEffect } from './effect'

export type Dep = Set<ReactiveEffect>

export const createDep = (effects?: ReactiveEffect[]): Dep => {
  const dep: Dep = new Set<ReactiveEffect>(effects)
  return dep
}
```

There is no definition of `effect` yet, but we will implement it later, so it's okay.

Next is `effect.ts`.

```ts
import { Dep, createDep } from './dep'

type KeyToDepMap = Map<any, Dep>
const targetMap = new WeakMap<any, KeyToDepMap>()

export let activeEffect: ReactiveEffect | undefined

export class ReactiveEffect<T = any> {
  constructor(public fn: () => T) {}

  run() {
    // â€» Save the activeEffect before executing fn and restore it after execution.
    // If you don't do this, it will be overwritten one after another and behave unexpectedly. (Let's restore it to its original state when you're done)
    let parent: ReactiveEffect | undefined = activeEffect
    activeEffect = this
    const res = this.fn()
    activeEffect = parent
    return res
  }
}

export function track(target: object, key: unknown) {
  let depsMap = targetMap.get(target)
  if (!depsMap) {
    targetMap.set(target, (depsMap = new Map()))
  }

  let dep = depsMap.get(key)
  if (!dep) {
    depsMap.set(key, (dep = createDep()))
  }

  if (activeEffect) {
    dep.add(activeEffect)
  }
}

export function trigger(target: object, key?: unknown) {
  const depsMap = targetMap.get(target)
  if (!depsMap) return

  const dep = depsMap.get(key)

  if (dep) {
    const effects = [...dep]
    for (const effect of effects) {
      effect.run()
    }
  }
}
```

I haven't explained the contents of `track` and `trigger` so far, but they simply register and retrieve from `targetMap` and execute them, so please try to read them carefully.

Next is `baseHandler.ts`. Here, we define the handler for the reactive proxy.
Well, you can implement it directly in `reactive`, but I followed the original Vue because it is like this.
In reality, there are various proxies such as `readonly` and `shallow`, so the idea is to implement the handlers for those proxies here. (We won't do it this time, though)

```ts
import { track, trigger } from './effect'
import { reactive } from './reactive'

export const mutableHandlers: ProxyHandler<object> = {
  get(target: object, key: string | symbol, receiver: object) {
    track(target, key)

    const res = Reflect.get(target, key, receiver)
    // If it is an object, make it reactive (this allows nested objects to be reactive as well).
    if (res !== null && typeof res === 'object') {
      return reactive(res)
    }

    return res
  },

  set(target: object, key: string | symbol, value: unknown, receiver: object) {
    let oldValue = (target as any)[key]
    Reflect.set(target, key, value, receiver)
    // check if the value has changed
    if (hasChanged(value, oldValue)) {
      trigger(target, key)
    }
    return true
  },
}

const hasChanged = (value: any, oldValue: any): boolean =>
  !Object.is(value, oldValue)
```

Here, `Reflect` appears, which is similar to `Proxy`, but while `Proxy` is for writing meta settings for objects, `Reflect` is for performing operations on existing objects.
Both `Proxy` and `Reflect` are APIs for meta programming related to objects in the JS engine, and they allow you to perform meta operations compared to using objects normally.
You can execute functions that change the object, execute functions that read the object, and check if a key exists, and perform various meta operations.
For now, it's okay to understand that `Proxy` is for meta settings at the stage of creating an object, and `Reflect` is for meta operations on existing objects.

Next is `reactive.ts`.

```ts
import { mutableHandlers } from './baseHandler'

export function reactive<T extends object>(target: T): T {
  const proxy = new Proxy(target, mutableHandlers)
  return proxy as T
}
```

Now that the implementation of `reactive` is complete, let's try using them when mounting.
`~/packages/runtime-core/apiCreateApp.ts`.

```ts
import { ReactiveEffect } from '../reactivity'

export function createAppAPI<HostElement>(
  render: RootRenderFunction<HostElement>,
): CreateAppFunction<HostElement> {
  return function createApp(rootComponent) {
    const app: App = {
      mount(rootContainer: HostElement) {
        const componentRender = rootComponent.setup!()

        const updateComponent = () => {
          const vnode = componentRender()
          render(vnode, rootContainer)
        }

        // From here
        const effect = new ReactiveEffect(updateComponent)
        effect.run()
        // To here
      },
    }

    return app
  }
}
```

Now, let's try it in the playground.

```ts
import { createApp, h, reactive } from 'chibivue'

const app = createApp({
  setup() {
    const state = reactive({ count: 0 })
    const increment = () => {
      state.count++
    }

    return function render() {
      return h('div', { id: 'my-app' }, [
        h('p', {}, [`count: ${state.count}`]),
        h('button', { onClick: increment }, ['increment']),
      ])
    }
  },
})

app.mount('#app')
```

Oops...

The rendering is working fine now, but something seems off.
Well, it's not surprising because in `updateComponent`, we create elements every time.
So, let's remove all the elements before each rendering.

![reactive_example_mistake](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chibivue-land/chibivue/main/book/images/reactive_example_mistake.png)

Modify the `render` function in `~/packages/runtime-core/renderer.ts` like this:

```ts
const render: RootRenderFunction = (vnode, container) => {
  while (container.firstChild) container.removeChild(container.firstChild) // Add code to remove all elements
  const el = renderVNode(vnode)
  hostInsert(el, container)
}
```

Now, how about this?

![reactive_example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chibivue-land/chibivue/main/book/images/reactive_example.png)

Now it seems to be working fine!

Now we can update the screen with `reactive`!
