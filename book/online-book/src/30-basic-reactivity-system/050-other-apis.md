# Other Reactivity APIs

::: warning
The implementation explained here is based on the version prior to the currently drafted [Reactivity Optimization](/30-basic-reactivity-system/005-reactivity-optimization).  \
Once [Reactivity Optimization](/30-basic-reactivity-system/005-reactivity-optimization) is completed, the content of this chapter will be updated to align with it.

## Let's implement other reactivity APIs!

- customRef
- readonly
- shallowReactive
- unref
- isProxy
- isReactive
- isReadonly

If you have come this far, you should be able to implement them by reading the source code without any explanations!
